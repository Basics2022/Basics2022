## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**Goal**
The main goal is to create a collaborative project able to provide a set of free open-source, easy-to-mantain, of Jupyter books that could be used as textbooks for high-schools and university.

The continual rise in textbook prices, unjustifiable outside of a monopolistic or cartel-like structure in the industry, is one of the key factors driving this project. And really, what's more useful than easing the burden on families, providing an even better service, and simultaneously destroying their cartel and cutting into their unjustified earnings?

A second ambitious objective aims to bring together traditional teaching and more innovative methods. It is my convinced opinion that doing helps to learn, but that innovative methods that do not include a minimum set of skills are dangerous and counterproductive for effective education.

My background is quite a technical one, so I'm starting from Math, Physics, and Introduction to Programming. I'm starting with Italian language, ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹, since I'm living in Italy and I'd like to target first the high-school. Next step is the English version.

Feel free to reach out, for collaboration and/or support.
